BC Docker Manager - Rebuild Instructions
=========================================

CRITICAL: The Install-BC-Helper.ps1 script has been fixed (v4.8).
You MUST rebuild the app from Windows PowerShell to bundle the updated script.

Run these commands from Windows PowerShell (as Administrator):

cd "C:\Users\DylanHewitt\OneDrive - CosmicBytez\Documents\Obsidian\CosmicBytez\AI-Projects\BC-Docker-Manager"

# Build the app
npm run electron:build:portable

# Or if you want the full installer:
npm run electron:build:win

The fixed script will be bundled at:
  dist/win-unpacked/resources/scripts/Install-BC-Helper.ps1

TEST DEPLOYMENT:
After rebuilding, test the deployment from the app. It should now work without port conflicts.

WHAT WAS FIXED:
- NAT cleanup now runs BEFORE Docker restarts (not after)
- Docker was recreating port mappings from persistent state before we could clean them
- This caused the "port already exists (0x803b0013)" errors

Version: 4.8 (2026-01-09)
